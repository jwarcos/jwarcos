👋 Hi, I’m João Marcos (@jwarcos)

🎓 I hold a degree in Computer Science (Teaching Licentiate) from UEMS and a postgraduate specialization in Geoprocessing from PUC Minas.

🌍 I work at the Environmental Military Police of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil), using geotechnologies to fight illegal deforestation and forest fires.

🛰️ I use R, Python, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, and QGIS to perform spatial analyses and build decision-support tools.

📊 I’m currently focused on developing dashboards and spatial data visualizations to monitor environmental enforcement KPIs and improve field productivity.

🤝 I’m here to connect with developers and geospatial professionals. Let’s collaborate on projects that create environmental impact through data.
